# Pistachio-16_Features-Dataset
Pistachio is a shelled fruit from the anacardiaceae family. 
The homeland of pistachio is the Middle East. 
The Kirmizi pistachios and Siirt pistachios are the major types grown and exported in Turkey. 
Since the prices, tastes, and nutritional values of these types differs, 
the type of pistachio becomes important when it comes to trade. 
This study aims to identify these two types of pistachios, which are frequently grown in Turkey, by classifying them via convolutional neural networks. 
Within the scope of the study, images of Kirmizi and Siirt pistachio types were obtained through the computer vision system. 
The pre-trained dataset includes a total of 2148 images, 1232 of Kirmizi type and 916 of Siirt type. 
Three different convolutional neural network models were used to classify these images. 
Models were trained by using the transfer learning method, with AlexNet and the pre-trained models VGG16 and VGG19. 
The dataset is divided as 80% training and 20% test. As a result of the performed classifications, the success rates obtained from the AlexNet, 
VGG16, and VGG19 models are 94.42%, 98.84%, and 98.14%, respectively.
Modelsâ€™ performances were evaluated through sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-1 score metrics. 
In addition, ROC curves and AUC values were used in the performance evaluation. 
The highest classification success was achieved with the VGG16 model. 
The obtained results reveal that these methods can be used successfully in the determination of pistachio types.
